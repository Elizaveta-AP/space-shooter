Space shooter with endless level. The player controls the spacecraft using the keyboard or joystick. 
You need to kill enemy ships and smash meteorites to get points. When colliding with meteorites or enemy lasers, lives are reduced. 
You can collect coins that appear on the screen, which can be spent on improvements (in development). 
The game has 4 slots for different players to save their progress. Saving the characteristics of players, their coins and a record is carried out using serialization.
During the game, with a set of 100 points, the difficulty increases: meteorites and opponents appear more often, they have more health, more speed, and do more damage.
In development: the appearance of bonuses during the game, the addition of new types of weapons, the leaderboard, changing the color of the interface.
